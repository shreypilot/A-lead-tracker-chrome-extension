The projects was to build a leads tracker chrome extension. I learned a lot while building this extension, the tutorial was interactive, I understood a lot of concepts better and also how to apply them.
A leads tracker Chrome extension is a Chrome extension that enables you to save websites/webpages URLs and keep track of them for future references. This extension allows you to save links and sites with great lead potentials. An example is LinkedIn. You can save and keep track of your connections using this extension, click on your connection's profile, open your leads tracker extension, and click on the save tab button. The webpage URL is saved, and you can always find it whenever the extension is open.
The save tab button saves your current tab's URL, the save input button enables you to add the description of your URL or save any URL which is not your current tab, and the delete all button deletes all saved tab URLs and inputs.
